                                    <p>You're seeing this error because this Tokaido proxy service was not able to get a valid response from either your Drupal site, or one of the intermediate Tokaido components like HAProxy or Varnish.</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Troubleshooting when not all containers are running</h3>
                                    <p>Each Tokaido environment is made up of at least 10 containers. Sometimes, which of these contains are failing can help you identify where the problem is originating</p>
                                    <p>To see which containers are failing:</p>
                                    <div class="code-block">
                                            <p><code>tok ps</code></p>
                                    </div><!--//code-block-->

                                    <p>A container has failed when it's "State" in the `tok ps` output is "Exit". If the State is up, the container is OK</p>

                                    <p>If the <strong>fpm</strong> container is failing, this indicates that your PHP FPM process - and thus Drupal - has crashed. In this scenario, you should run <eM>tok logs fpm</em> to view the logs of your PHP FPM process. Any catastrophic PHP errors which cause FPM to panic will be captured here.</p>

                                    <p>Other PHP FPM logs are stored in the <em>/tokaido/logs/nginx/error.log</em> file. If your <em>drush</em> and <em>nginx</em> containers are running, you can access this by SSHing into the Tokaido environment and running <em>tail /tokaido/logs/nginx/error.log</em></p>

                                    <p>If the <strong>nginx</strong>, <strong>varnish</strong>, or <strong>haproxy</strong> containers are failing but the <em>fpm</em> container is running, this is likely to be a result of a startup timing issue. Although, this is very unlikely to occur. The quickest fix for this should be to run <em>tok up</em> once more</p>

                                    <p>Generally, in Tokaido, if FPM is failing then other contains will fail (because they can't reach their next-hop). Otherwise, if FPM is working the other containers shoudl work</p>

                                    <p>If the <strong>drush</strong> container is failing alone, this might be due to an issue with your SSH config. This is also very rare, and can most likely be fixed by running <em>tok up</em> again</p>
                                </div>

                                <div id="step3"  class="section-block">
                                    <h3 class="block-title">Troubleshooting when SSH access is not working</h3>
                                    <p>When Tokaido is run on your system for the very first time, it creates a public/private SSH key pair and saves it in <strong>~/.ssh</strong>. This key never changes unless you delete it, and is used by exclusively by Tokaido locally.</p>

                                    <p>After this key is created, the first time to run <strong>tok up</strong> on a project, the public key is copied to the <strong>.tok/local/</strong> directory. SSH looks for this key to authenticate your SSH user when your run <strong>ssh {{project-name}}.tok</strong></p>

                                    <p>If you're having problems with SSH not working, it is probably because your key has been changed or the Drush container is failing for some other reason. Running <strong>tok logs drush</strong> should give you more information.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div id="step4"  class="section-block">
                                    <h3 class="block-title">Troubleshooting when Drupal is not listening</h3>
                                    <p>If all containers are running and SSH is working, but Drupal is still not working, then it's likely that your Drupal site itself is broken. This means that Tokaido is probably working fine.</p>

                                    <p>The easiest way to verify this is to try and access Drupal directly via the <strong>nginx</strong> container. This will bypass all of the other Tokaido components like <strong>haproxy</strong> and <strong>varnish</strong> that might be messing things up.</p>

                                    <p>To access Nginx directly, you bypass this proxy service and access Nginx on it's local Docker port mapping:</p>

                                    <div class="code-block">
                                            <p><code>tok open nginx</code></p>
                                    </div>

                                    If this works and the site load properly, you've most likely found a bug in Tokaido. If you could please help us fix it, that would be great!
